Bob the Builder
===============

Given a Buildable object with the following public API:

- #repo_kind                               #=> :git, :svn, ...
- #repo_uri                                #=> "git://github.com/foca/bob.git"
- #repo_branch                             #=> "master"
- #build_script                            #=> "make test && make && make install"
- #start_building(commit_id, commit_info)
- #add_successful_build(commit_id, output)
- #add_failed_build(commit_id, output)

Bob will, when called like:

    Bob.build(buildable, commit_id)

1. Checkout the buildable on the specified commit
2. Call `buildable.start_building`
3. Run the script provided in `build_script` in the buildable.
4. If the script returns a status code of 0 it calls `add_successful_build` on the
   buildable with the appropriate arguments. If not, it calls `add_failed_build`.

Do I need this?

Probably not. Check out http://integrityapp.com for a full fledged automated CI
