= Bob the Builder

Given a Buildable object with a determined API (described in it's documentation), 
Bob will, when called like:

    Bob.build(buildable, commit_id) # or Bob.build(buildable, [commit_id, commit_id, ...])

or from your buildable (if you are using the Bob::Buildable mixin provided) as:

    buildable.build(commit_id) # or buildable.build([commit_id, commit_id, ...])

1. Checkout the buildable on the specified commit
2. Call <tt>Buildable#start_building</tt>
3. Run the script provided in <tt>Buildable#build_script</tt> in the buildable.
4. When the build process finishes, it will call <tt>Buildable#finish_building</tt> with
   the commit_id, the build status (true if the script returns a status code
   of 0, false otherwise), and a string with the build output (both STDOUT and STDERR).

If you pass an array of commits, the steps 1-4 will be repeated for each commit provided,
in order.
