  # The second argument will take an array of commit_ids, which should be
  # strings with the relevant identifier (a SHA1 hash for git repositories,
  # a numerical revision for svn repositories, etc).
  #
  # You can pass :head as a commit identifier to build the latest commit
  # in the repo. Examples:
  #
  #     Bob.build(buildable, :head) # just build the head
  #     Bob.build(buildable, ["4", "3", "2"]) # build revision 4, 3, and 2
  #                                           # (in that order)
  #     Bob.build(buildable, [:head, "a30fb12"]) # build the HEAD and a30fb12
  #                                              # commits in this repo.
